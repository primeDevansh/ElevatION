The recent reassessment of the company indicated a decline in its ESG performance relative to its ESG industry peers, driving the downgrade. Further, our revised methodology has resulted in a higher carbon emission exposure score for natural gas power generation (11.4% of FY 2021 operations) and electric transmission and distribution (~49% of FY 2021 operations) segments, contributing to the downgrade.The company pledged to phase out coal power generation by 2035 (~41% of total installed capacity in 2021) through coal-to-gas conversion. We note new climate targets by some of its business units. The company blends hydrogen into gas distribution networks and aims to replace natural gas with hydrogen. Also, UKPN and SAPN, two electricity transmission and distribution units, adopt voltage management technologies to prepare the networks for renewables.The company continues to trail most global peers on corporate governance, notably in board structure. That said, we note no significant votes against directors at the 2022 AGM; this may indicate improved shareholder satisfaction.With a relatively diversified asset portfolio, compared to pure thermal power generators, the company has moderate exposure to risks tied to toxic releases.

On the other hand, it lags peers in adopting strong chemical safety management practices.The toxic emissions intensive nature of manufacturing printing ink and paints exposes DIC to the risk of incurring potential environmental liabilities. Our research indicates 79% of its facilities are certified to the ISO 14001 standard . Further, DIC's VOC emission intensity decreased by a compound annual rate of 24% between 2017 to 2020.DIC derived 45% of its FY 2021 revenue from Japan and the US, where chemical safety regulations are stringent. It is thus exposed to potential reformulation costs. While we note the company undertakes reformulation of specific products, it appears to lack a formal plan to phase out all hazardous chemicals from its operations, unlike better-performing peers.Enhanced executive pay disclosures have contributed positively to the company's corporate governance score, which remains average compared with those of global peers.

The Whistleblower Protection Key Metric under the Business Ethics Key Issue was modified. Otsuka has disclosed a policy that provides whistleblowers with protection from retaliation, which contributed to the upgrade. Also, unlike the case in our previous assessment (Nov. 26, 2021), we note the presence of an independent pay committee; this may help provide independent oversight of executive pay practices. Further, Otsuka's talent management programs continue to lead those of industry peers.Strong competition for skilled talent in the IT consulting industry exposes Otsuka to potential talent management complexity. Nonetheless, our research suggests it has industry-leading practices such as annual engagement surveys and graduate internship programs that may help recruit and retain talent. Further, Otsuka's attrition rate at 4.8% for 2018-20 was lower than the industry average of 13% (as of June 2022).Like leading peers, Otsuka appears to capitalize well on the growing demand for clean technology solutions, mainly through its digital transformation offerings, which facilitate optimization of clients' processes.Despite improvements, Otsuka still lags most global peers on corporate governance. This is because its board lacks an independent majority, and is potentially entrenched (5 of 10 directors have served over 15 years: March 2022). Also, it is led by a combined CEO/chair.

In 2021, the company initiated a trial of a digital wallet product for cashless gambling in Australia. While the wallet reportedly includes self-limit options, we note the convenience the technology brings--to access funds--may present risks for problem gamblers.Aristocrat's mobile games and its trials for cashless gambling may pose cybersecurity challenges as these collect personal data.

Idemitsu primarily engages in petroleum refining and chemical manufacturing (75% operations FY 2021), and has a growing presence in renewable energy generation. Despite the limited opportunities to expand its business in the clean technology (cleantech) arena, its R&D efforts continue to lead those of its refining peers. However, Idemitsu's strategies in minimizing the carbon footprint and toxic effluents of its operations remain average compared to those of peers.In FY 2021, Idemitsu grew its generation capacity by 25% YoY to 1.8 GW, where renewable energy such as solar, biomass, wind, and geothermal accounted for 39% of the power mix. Further, it has increased R&D expenditures by 6% CAGR (2019-21), with its three-year R&D/sales average of 0.38 outperforming industry average (0.17) as of August 2022.Most of Idemitsu's operations are based in Japan (84% FY 2021) where carbon regulations are becoming stringent, based on our model. This may further expose the company to risks of additional compliance costs tied to carbon emissions. In line with its net-zero target by 2050, however, its three-year (2018-20) GHG intensity of 251.7 mtCO2e/mUSD was lower than the industry average of 267 as of August 2022.Idemitsu's operations pose lower risk of workplace incidents than those of pure-play refining peers.

Further, its investment programs to capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable properties lag those of leading local market peers.Property developers may face operational disruptions in the event of workplace accidents. Yet, Zensun Enterprises does not appear to disclose its employee and contractor safety performance, or to set targets to improve performance, unlike leading peers.The company trail peers on corporate governance practices. Two directors of its six-member board are executives, and one holds both the CEO and chairman roles. Such a structure may result in a strong management influence on the board. Further, the presence of related-party transactions with a family firm director could create potential for board-level conflicts of interest, and undermine minority shareholder interests.China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) brings an industry-wide trend of urban renewal, thus presenting Zensun Enterprises with opportunities in green development.

This, combined with the lack of a majority independent board, may undermine minority investor interests. On business ethics, it does not appear to undertake anti-corruption audits. The company trails peers in responsible mineral sourcing programs.Bajaj Electricals' household electric products could contain minerals in their components that could be sourced from conflict regions; this exposes the company to reputational risks. Yet, the company does not appear to implement mineral sourcing policies or vendor due diligence that could help restrict procurement from conflict-prone regions.Bajaj Electricals operates mainly in India (FY 2021: ~97% revenue), where e-waste management regulations are evolving; this suggests moderate exposure to related regulatory risks. However, we found no evidence of leading practices such as take-back initiatives or e-waste recycling targets.Bajaj Electricals outsources the bulk of its manufacturing to third-party suppliers.

The company lacks a fully independent audit committee to oversee related-party transactions with its controlling owner. Meanwhile, it seems to be on par with peers on community engagement initiatives.As the company is involved in coal mining and metallurgical alloy production (FY 2021: 48% of revenue), Inner Mongolia ERDOS may face compliance costs arising from increasingly stringent carbon regulations in China. Yet, the company appears to have limited decarbonization practices. We also found no evidence on its carbon emission figures or quantitative reduction targets--this may impede peer comparison.Electrometallurgical production could pose the risk of incurring environmental liabilities associated with air pollution. Although Inner Mongolia ERDOS has adopted measures to address the toxic emissions, we found no evidence of quantitative reduction targets, unlike with better-performing peers.Inner Mongolia ERDOS has initiatives to mitigate risks related to the impact of its operations on surrounding communities. Like peers, it has community development programs and support for local hiring and procurement; these could help foster and improve local relations.",3.8,9.0,1.4,9.0,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,,10.0,Materials,Global Enterprises Worldwide

Rechargeable battery operations constitute 46.4% of LG Chem's FY 2021 assets; thus, its carbon intensity may be lower relative to industry peers operating solely in the petrochemicals business. Nevertheless, in 2022, it set a target to achieve net zero status by 2050 (revising its previous target of carbon neutral growth by 2050). Further, its carbon mitigation practices are robust: notably, by 2030, it aims to source power at overseas sites entirely from renewable energy sources.LG Chem's governance practices lag those of global peers. It is controlled via a stock pyramid structure and has multiple share classes with disparate voting rights, which may lead to misalignment between voting rights and economic exposure. LG Chem has faced ethics controversies; notably, it faced allegations of dumping of its products in the US as of January 2022.We note LG Polymers India (a subsidiary of LG Chem) may incur environmental liabilities linked to a gas leak that resulted in 12 deaths in 2020. It awaits final assessment from National Green Tribunal of India and Andhra Pradesh High Court regarding this incident (as of June 2022). The accident may indicate lapses in the implementation of its toxic emissions management and safety oversight.As LG Chem derived 88% of its FY 2021 revenue from countries with stringent chemical regulations, it is exposed to potential reformulation costs.

Consequently, its exposure to the risk of incurring carbon pricing costs due to relatively less stringent regulations and increased the risk of incurring liabilities associated with workplace accidents due to high occupational injury rates in the region.Executive pay practices of Santos' board appear to be generally well aligned with sustainable shareholder interests. Moreover, the company has an independent board majority, split roles of CEO and chair, and fully independent key committees. This structure may support the board's independent oversight of management.Santos' transition plan focuses on achieving net-zero scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040 to manage carbon pricing costs in Australia, despite its intention to increase hydrocarbon production by 120 MMboe per year by 2030. Its transition relies on its plans to invest in a blue hydrogen production business model, scaling up of carbon capture and storage, and an undisclosed quantity of nature-based offsets.While Santos has a groupwide workplace safety policy, we found no evidence of internationally recognized occupational safety certifications, unlike with better-performing peers.",2.7,12.0,4.6,19.0,,0.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,10.0,Energy,Hospitaland Clinical Services Industries

Also, RATCH increased its coal power capacity to 20% (FY 2021: 1.8GW) from 13% (FY 2020: 0.9GW); this may expose the company to increased compliance and operational costs tied to environmental liabilities. Further, it lags industry peers in managing environmental risks as we found no evidence on targets to reduce GHG emission intensity.In 2021, 91% of RATCH's operations were in water-intensive thermal power generation; this may pose an increased risk of operational disruption in case of water scarcity. Despite board-level oversight, it lags most industry peers on water management practices; we found no evidence of water reduction targets.Based on our model, incidence of corruption is perceived to be high in the utilities industry--a risk that can be aggravated by government ownership (FY 2021: 45%). RATCH lags global peers on corporate behavior. Notably, we found no evidence of periodic audits of ethics standards or of an anti-corruption policy that covers all suppliers.

Further, as of Oct. 2021, executives and government representatives comprised 56% of SIUD's board; this could negatively impact independent oversight of management.Property developers' reliance on construction permits could create potential incentives for bribery. Further, as a state-owned entity, SIUD may face increased scrutiny of its business ethics practices. Yet, it appears to lack a detailed anti-corruption policy and whistleblower protection program.Property developers, in general, may face risks of project disruptions and liabilities in case of worksite safety incidents. While SIUD has instituted a safety committee which is supervised by the CEO, it lags peers in setting injury reduction targets and obtaining safety management certifications.China targets to have 70% of new developments certified to green standards by 2022; this creates opportunities to leverage the demand for sustainable properties for companies such as SIUD. The company appears on par with peers in adopting energy- and water-saving measures during construction. However, limited disclosure on the portion of SIUD's portfolio certified to green building standards impedes comparison of performance with peers.",,0.0,9.0,0.0,,0.0,4.0,,3.0,,10.0,Real Estate,Transportation Infrastructure Innovations

Notably, two independent directors replaced previous executives on the board at the 2022 AGM, increasing independent representation to 58% (FY 2020: 42%); this may bolster management oversight.The company's suite of products, which includes pollution control systems and products that may offer energy efficiency, may help tap the growing demand for clean technology. It recorded a three-year (2018-20) average R&D expense/sales of 4.6%; this is on par with the industry average of 5.2% as of May 2022.Our reassessment of the company's operations, mainly in Japan (FY 2020: ~76% of assets), resulted in a decrease in corruption risk exposure. Like leading peers, its ethics framework is backed by a non-retaliation policy to protect whistleblowers, which may help preempt potential unethical dealings. However, it faces controversy in Japan over alleged falsified inspection data for multiple products since 2018.Mitsubishi Electric is on par with peers on efforts to manage potential challenges tied to its labor-intensive operations. Controversies, however, related to workplace harassment and labor conditions were recorded from 2019 to 2021; this may indicate potential gaps in its labor management practices.",,0.0,9.0,0.0,,0.0,2.0,,2.0,,10.0,Other,Marine Transport Group

It leads home market peers in corporate governance notably due to an independent board and split CEO and chair roles that facilitate independent management oversight. Also, despite high reliance on a skilled workforce in the talent-intensive IT industry, Fujitsu has maintained a lower attrition rate (common among Japanese industry peers) aided by long-term career development plans and upskilling initiatives. Fujitsu also appears well-positioned to monetize on cleantech opportunities.Our research indicates historically low incidents of corruption in Japan. This lowers the company's exposure to risk of corruption, relative to global peers.

Tingyi was reclassified in September 2022 from Packaged Foods & Meats to Soft Drinks industry. It derived 60% of its 2021 revenue from the sale of beverages such as tea and juice. As the production of these drinks, including agricultural inputs upstream, is water-intensive, Tingyi may face operational risks in case of water shortages. Yet, it lags peers in promoting water resilience in its operations, and its agricultural supply chain, which accounts for the bulk of its water footprint.Tingyi lags most global peers on corporate governance. Its board lacks independent majority and includes both executive chair and CEO. These factors, along with the company's controlled structure, may subordinate the interests of minority shareholders. We also note recurring related-party transactions with the controlling owner 12% and 10% of expenses in 2020 and 2021, respectively.Tingyi may face lower risk exposure to packaging waste as it operates fully in China (2021), where packaging regulation is perceived to be low as per our model.

These may help monitor and improve job satisfaction.Johnson Electric is average relative to industry peers in monetizing growth opportunities in clean technology (cleantech). The company's offerings find application in electrified vehicles, which may help it benefit from the increasing adoption of the same. Also, a three-year (FY 2019-2021) average R&D/sales ratio of 5.20% (vs. industry average of 4.64%, as of December 2022), may help it expand its capacity for cleantech innovation.As of September 2022, 5 of 11 board members--including the combined CEO/chair and deputy chair--were members of the controlling family (held ~61% shares). Four of them have served for over 38 years; this may raise entrenchment concerns, which may be exacerbated by the presence of the CEO in the nomination committee. Such structures may not align with minority investor interests.",,,10.0,,,,1.0,,2.0,,10.0,Other,Nuclear Energy Developments

The rating continues to reflect weaknesses around the company's corporate governance structures that may pose risks to minority shareholder interests. The controlling shareholder (31.3% of voting rights, as of November 2021) maintains strong influence through a stock pyramid structure, its board seats and management role. Shareholders' influence on board and company decisions also appears restricted due to BEM's classified board, wherein directors do not face annual elections.While BEM's board maintains an independent majority, entrenchment risks and the presence of an executive chairman may limit its scope for independent oversight of management. Further, the ability of the chair--who is also the CEO--to provide leadership may be limited due to external board commitments.Operating extensive, long-lived highway and railway assets could adversely impact community rights or safety, and thus trigger local opposition, including legal challenges. BEM appears to undertake charitable programs and community development projects. Yet, unlike the case with industry leaders, we found no evidence of strong community engagement efforts such as local councils to discuss social and environmental issues.Exposure to risks linked to workplace safety incidents is relatively high for companies, such as BEM, that develop, construct, and maintain transportation infrastructure. BEM's practices appear on par with those of industry peers, and includes ISO 45001 certification (scope undisclosed).",7.2,19.0,8.0,0.0,,0.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,10.0,Industrials,Gaming Technology Inc.

Programs to manage Sanwa's toxic streams are also on par with those of peers--evidence indicates ISO 14001 certifications, recycling efforts, and reducing water use for its painting processes.Door and shutter designs are standardized; this may pose low clean technology opportunities. Nonetheless, Sanwa has developed thermally efficient and solar-powered shutters. Its offerings also include shutters and doors built to withstand seismic loads and hurricane wind loads; these may help improve a building's structural resilience during adverse weather events.Metal products manufacturing entail cutting, forming, and welding processes, which are linked to occupational noise exposure and potential worker injuries. Sanwa's safety management is overseen at executive level, and includes audits, contractor oversight, and traffic safety controls--on par with better-performing peers.While non-independent boards are common in Japan, there are no female directors on the company's board; this may limit diversity of views.

The company appears to lack strong practices related to ESG Key Issues. Allegations of anticompetitive practices further weigh on its rating. Since 2016, NHK Spring has been investigated by antitrust regulators from Japan, Brazil, and United States for alleged price-fixing, and received a cease-and-desist order in Hong Kong in 2018. While the company's ethics practices feature whistleblower protection and executive oversight, the controversies may indicate potential gaps in implementation.Like most home-market peers, NHK Spring lacks an independent majority board and split CEO-chairman roles. This may limit the board's ability to provide independent management oversight. We note the external audit firm has served for over twenty years; excessive familiarity between the auditor and the management may create potential conflict of interest.NHK Spring manufactures suspension systems (accounted for 17.8% of FY 2020 revenues)--a safety-critical auto component--and thus has exposure to regulatory and financial risks in the event of product quality lapses. The company's quality assurance practices appear to trail that of peers: we found limited evidence of supplier training on product quality.Our research indicates low exposure to risks related to labor unrest, as the bulk of the company's operations (71% in FY 2020) is based in Japan and Thailand, where ILO data indicates low likelihood of labor unrest.

Also, the company has initiatives, including a groundwater recharge project to replenish water used in operations. Like leading peers, Asahi has robust measures to mitigate risks tied to potentially misleading advertisements.As a beer producer (76% of operations in FY 2021), Asahi relies on barley--which is highly water intensive--and may face risks of increased input costs in case of water shortages. Like leading peers, the company extends its water risk assessment to the agricultural supply chain; this may improve oversight of water risks.Asahi Group is a member of the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking and has a dedicated responsible marketing policy, backed by auditing and training programs for all employees. In 2021, no-/low-alcohol (NOLO) options accounted for 10% of sales volume, and the company has set a quantitative target--a rare practice in the industry--to increase its NOLO sales volume to 15% by 2025.On corporate behavior, the company leads most global peers. It has a policy that provides whistleblowers protection against retaliation, supported by audits and training for permanent employees.

However, it trails most industry peers in mitigating labor-related risks.In August 2022, DFG launched its electric off-road brand M Hero. It has another dedicated new energy vehicle (NEV) brand in Voyah. Besides, with the 263% increase in unit sales relative to FY 2020, NEVs constituted 5.8% of DFG's total sales (by volume) in FY 2021. These may help mitigate risks tied to tailpipe GHG emission regulations.DFG remains average relative to global peers on corporate governance. Yet, recurring related-party transactions with the state (held 66.9% shares as of December 2021) may not align with minority investor interests. DFG continues to lag global peers on business ethics practices; the associated risks may be exacerbated by state ownership and the perceived high exposure to corruption risks in the automobiles industry, as per our model.Over 2016-2021, DFG's workforce reduced at a compound annual rate of 3.9%.

Despite lagging global and home market peers in corporate governance, we note that, as of January 2023, GAIL has improvements in its board composition. Mr. Sandeep Gupta, who replaced Mr. Manoj Jain as chair and CEO as of October 2022, serves on fewer boards. Fewer external board commitments may strengthen the board's effectiveness in providing management oversight. However, we note a decline in GAIL's safety performance.Though GAIL's safety practices have been certified to ISO 45001 standards and a board-level committee oversees safety issues, we note that a subcontractor died in an accident in May 2021.For gas utilities, decarbonization pressure is mainly on Scopes 2 and 3. GAIL mitigates such risks by applying leak detection systems in its network. Further, the company targets net zero GHG emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2040, and reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 35% by the same year (from an FY 2020-2021 baseline). The company is also making headways into hydrogen R&D through its stake in ONGC Tripura Power Company. These may allay long-term stranded asset risks and aid India's target of reducing emissions intensity to 45% of 2005 levels by 2030.The utilities industry is typically perceived to have high incidence of corruption, which could be heightened by state ownership.

That said, the company's business ethics initiatives appear to lack training and audit mechanisms.Koa's products, such as resistors, may contain minerals such as tin that could expose its supply chain to risks associated with conflict minerals sourcing. Unlike leading industry peers, the company appears to lack strong policies addressing raw minerals procurement as well as due diligence programs to monitor upstream supply chain, including smelters.Around 62% of Koa's FY 2020 revenue was derived from markets with stringent chemical regulations (US, Japan, Europe). While Koa has measures to track hazardous chemicals in its products, the company trails industry peers, overall. Evidence suggests limited efforts to phase out chemicals of concern and conduct life cycle assessments of products.With around 82% of operations in Japan, where ILO data indicates low incidence of labor unrest, and a small workforce (3,932 vs 17,500 industry average), the company's exposure to labor-related risks is moderate.

Delta is a manufacturer of electronic components for the power supply industry, and thus, has opportunities to tap into clean technology. It leads peers in providing energy-efficient solutions, including solar inverters and LED drivers. Further, its large workforce (87,366 vs. 32,000 industry average, as of June 2022) presents higher labor management complexity than peers. Nevertheless, Delta's labor management practices such as robust incentive schemes lead those of industry peers.Delta derived 100% FY 2021 revenues from the US, Taiwan, Thailand, and China--markets with stringent laws on chemical safety--thus exposing the company to risks of reformulation costs. Nevertheless, Delta's above par performance includes broad-based monitoring protocol for chemical identification.Electronic components such as inductors and resistors generally use 3TGs (Tin, Tungsten, Tantalum, or Gold). This exposes Delta to reputational or regulatory risks if conflict minerals are traced in its products or supply chain. Delta's material procurement practices are on par with those of peers. Its efforts to engage with suppliers appear to include monitoring and training programs.Delta lags most home market peers in corporate governance.

On corporate governance, Hanatour continues to lag most global peers.The company's board lacks a majority of independent directors, as well as an independent chair. This may limit management oversight. Further, the absence of a pay committee and limited disclosure on executive pay may not be aligned with investors' long-term interests.Hanatour has data security measures, such as encryption. However, unlike leading peers, it appears to lack penetration testing to assess system vulnerability. Also, Hanatour's information systems appear to lack certifications to globally recognized data security standards such as ISO 27001.Our model suggests Hanatour operates in regions (FY 2021: 100% of assets in Asia, including South Korea) where there is moderate to high likelihood of labor unrest. The company has industry-standard employee benefits to mitigate related labor risks. Recent company disclosures also suggest evidence of education support provided to select staff. However, we found no evidence of annual engagement surveys which may limit its ability to assess workforce satisfaction.",,,5.3,5.0,,,4.0,,4.0,,10.0,Leisure,Logisticsand Distribution Technologies

Keiyo's corporate governance and business ethics practices continue to lag those of global peers. The company also appears to trail peers in implementing stringent data security initiatives. On the upside, it has a small workforce (1,094 in FY 2021 vs. industry average of 81,204 as of April 2022) and its operations are solely in Japan, where the likelihood of labor unrest is low (as per ILO data). Its exposure to risk of operational disruptions from strikes is thus lower than that of peers.Like most Japanese peers, Keiyo's board lacks an independent majority; this could limit its ability to provide management oversight. We also note related-party transactions with a non-controlling owner (~62% of FY 2021 expenses); this, in the absence of a fully independent audit committee, may increase governance risk for minority investors.

Morinaga aims to achieve these targets by 2030, suggesting a reinforced focus on minimizing its environmental footprint. However, the company continues to lag leading peers in adopting robust environmental measures in the agricultural supply chain, where the bulk of its environmental footprint lies.Reliance on water-intensive agricultural commodities, such as sourced sugar and dairy, for confectionery production may pose the risk of increased input costs in case of water shortages. Though Moringa has assessed water-related risks in its operations, we found no evidence of broad measures to reduce water use or of engagements with agricultural suppliers on water conservation and resilience.Morinaga lags global and home market peers on corporate governance.

Misumi's labor-related programs appear average, relative to peers. The company offers non-pay benefits and stock option plans, as well as training to upskill employees. Its governance practices are also generally average relative to global peers. However, while most peers in the machinery industry accelerate innovation and align strategies to develop clean technology (cleantech) products, Misumi seems to lag peers in increasing its capacity to tap opportunities in the cleantech space.Our research found some improvements in the company's board structure and pay practices. At the 2022 AGM, the company included one female director and no directors received significant negative votes (2 directors; 2021 AGM); this may indicate shareholder satisfaction. The company has also disclosed the CEO's pay details. However, it continues to have a non-independent majority board, which while typical among Japanese firms, may limit management oversight.Misumi's factory automation and die components segments (53% of FY 2021 revenue) may offer growth opportunities in the cleantech market. While we note the company's focus on developing products that enable digitalization and energy efficiency, it appears to have limited investments in cleantech development. The company's three-year average R&D/sales investment--a potential indicator of long-term innovation capacity--was 0.38% during 2018-2021, lower than the industry average of 5.13% as of October 2022.",,0.0,7.5,0.0,,0.0,3.0,,4.0,,10.0,Industrials,Corporate Diversification Worldwide

As a result, its exposure to risks associated with labor complexity is relatively low. Like leading peers, we found evidence of collective agreements and non-statutory benefits. On the downside, the company lags global peers on overall governance practices.Nitori's business ethics framework is reinforced with a detailed policy against bribery and corruption to preempt potential unethical dealings. It also has a whistleblower policy against retaliation. However, like Japanese peers, its board lacks an independent majority, and 2 of 12 directors have had tenures of over 15 years (Jun 2022). These factors could limit management oversight.As a retailer with online presence, Nitori collects and handles customers' data; this may expose it to regulatory and reputational risks in case of data breach. While our reassessment indicates the company has data breach prevention and response plans, it appears to lack external data system audits and certification such as ISO 27001, unlike leading peers.Nitori is exposed to risks related to labor rights violation in the supply chain, as ~90% of its products (FY 2021) are sourced from developing countries, where incidence of poor working conditions is high as per model.

However, the firm lags most global peers on corporate governance.Maxvalu's online and in-store retail transactions may expose it to risks tied to data breach and misuse.

Also, the controlling owner held 38% of voting rights (July 2022) via a stock pyramid structure; this may not align with minority investor interests.Limited executive pay disclosures by NEOWIZ limit the assessment of its pay practices. We also found limited disclosure on its business ethics framework and related compliance programs; this impedes comparison with those of global and home market peers.Reliance on tech-oriented talent to develop games may expose NEOWIZ to talent management challenges.

That said, we note three non-executive directors are overboarded (as of October 2022); this may hinder management oversight.We have revised our evaluation of exposure to product safety and quality risks by removing a company-specific component based on the size of operations. This has resulted in an increase in Torrent's overall risk exposure. Further, we note one Class II (moderate), five Class III (minor) product recalls, and one Form 483 warning from January 2020 to November 2022.Like pharma peers, Torrent relies on highly skilled staff for its operations.

A revision to our evaluation of exposure to product safety and quality risks, by removing a company-specific component which was based on the size of operations, also contributed to the upgrade.Given its sizeable motorcycle sales (80% of vehicles sold in 2021, 15% of revenues), Honda may face lower exposure to risks linked to tailpipe emission norms than peers that produce only four-wheelers. The company aims to achieve 100% fully electric and fuel cell vehicle sales portfolio by 2040, as part of its 2050 carbon neutrality goal.Honda adopts an industry-typical quality management system, equipped with ISO 9001 certifications (56 of 60 production sites, as of February 2022) and supply chain quality auditing mechanisms. However, its product warranties comprise 3% of its revenue (2019-2021), exceeding the industry average of 1.5%, as of November 2022. Also, as of March 2022, Honda remains linked to recall efforts and probes over alleged defective airbags.Our reassessment of Honda's employee management programs reflects lagging efforts relative to industry leaders. We found limited evidence of performance incentives and shareholding plans provided to non-officer staff--measures that may help boost labor productivity.",,,10.0,,,,1.0,,3.0,,10.0,Other,Healthcare Software Technologies

The upgrade reflects improvements in Air China's corporate governance, which is now average relative to global peers. Related-party transactions with the controlling owner were down to 0.016% of total revenue in FY 2021 (2020: 13.02%); this may reduce potential governance risks for investors. However, as a state-owned entity whose ethics practices may face risk of regulatory scrutiny, as our model suggests, we found no evidence of best practices such as whistleblower protection mechanisms.The company's product safety and quality management practices are average relative to industry peers. Its operations are certified to the IATA Operational Safety Audit program, and its average on-time performance of 86.7% for FY 2019-2021 was higher than the industry-average of 83.6% as of November 2022.Air China has robust privacy measures to protect against breaches and address increasingly stringent data privacy regulations. Besides its ISO 27001-certified information security management system, it has established a data breach response plan and employs data encryption techniques. We also note privacy training for staff, though the scope and frequency seem to be undisclosed.Air China exhibits strong progress in reducing carbon emissions. It maintains a young fleet (8.2 years in FY 2021 vs. 9.6 industry average, as of November 2022), which may provide increased fuel efficiencies. Its three-year average carbon emission intensity of 122.5 gCO2e/rpk (FY 2019-2021) was lower than the industry average of 353, as of November 2022.",,0.0,6.1,19.0,,0.0,3.0,,2.0,,10.0,Transportation,Sportsand Recreation Developments

While OSG offers career development initiatives, it appears to trail peers in providing engagement channels and performance incentives to sustain workforce morale and productivity.OSG's operations involving metal cutting machine tools pose moderate exposure to risk of environmental liabilities and compliance costs linked to toxic emissions and waste. We note ISO 14001 certification for its environmental management system. However, it has yet to tie its executive compensation to environmental performance, considered a best practice among leading peers.Through its production of lightweight products for less fuel consumption, OSG has opportunities to tap the increasing demand for clean technology products.

The upgrade is largely driven by improvements in Cholamandalam Investment and Finance's (CIF's) initiatives for customer financial protection. Our reassessment found evidence of transparent lending policies, which may help safeguard customer interests. Further, consumer complaints decreased by ~30% YoY in FY 2021. Our research indicates CIF adopts certain industry-best practices of annual external audits and penetration testing; these may help preempt potential cybersecurity incidents.The company's corporate governance is average relative to global peers--the board has an independent majority. However, CIF is a controlled company: a single shareholder controls ~52% of voting power (FY 2022); this may pose risks for minority shareholder interests. The company lags global peers on business ethics practices. We note multiple tax controversies since 2019; this may indicate gaps in its internal control mechanisms.CIF relies on skilled staff to manage customer relationships. Yet, it lags industry peers in adopting robust employee management practices, such as talent development programs and grievance redressal mechanisms, which may support staff retention.CIF's performance on Access to Finance (ATF)--which focuses on efforts to expand financial services in underserved market segments--has improved since the last rating action. In FY 2021, the company launched a dedicated loans division to boost rural penetration in India.

BCIA continues to lag global and home market peers in corporate governance practices. The board lacks an independent director majority; this may strengthen the management's influence over the board and limit independent oversight. Further, the company's involvement in recurring related-party transactions with the Government of China (59% voting rights, as of August 2022), which reinforces control through board seats, may subordinate the interests of minority investors.Operating one of China's largest airports poses risks related to local opposition due to potential land-use conflicts or adverse impacts on community rights. Yet, we found limited disclosure on local community engagements or on social impact assessments to manage such risks.As a state-controlled entity, BCIA has high exposure to corruption risks, as per our model, particularly amid the Chinese government's anti-corruption drive. Like most state-owned firms, the company reinforces its anti-corruption policy with audits and ethics training for staff. However, we found no evidence of whistleblower protection.Airport operators, such as BCIA, have relatively low exposure to risks of operational disruptions tied to workplace incidents than peers engaged in port and cargo handling and rail track maintenance activities. BCIA's safety practices, which include audits and zero-incident targets, remain average relative to peers. Yet, we found limited disclosure on lost time injury rates; this impedes peer comparison.",9.3,19.0,4.3,0.0,,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,10.0,Industrials,Cloud Computing Systems

Tencent faces several business ethics controversies that contribute to its current ESG Rating. These include allegations of having an indirect role in the infringement of civil liberties through the surveillance of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities, in conjunction with Chinese government authorities. It also faces investigations by the People's Bank of China into alleged anti-money laundering violations. In 2022, it was fined USD 2.3 million over alleged violations of anti-monopoly laws.Prosus reduced its stake in Tencent to 28.8% voting rights, as of May 2022, which is below our controlling shareholder threshold (30%). However, its affiliated directors Mr. Koos Bekker and Mr. Charles Searle retained their board seats. Also, the company's VIE structure and entrenched board indicate that control remains concentrated with Mr. Huateng Ma.Tencent's diversifying global market presence may add to its talent management risks, especially relative to peers with leading talent diversity practices. We note strong practices by the company, relative to industry peers, on engagement initiatives. However, in December 2021, Riot Games (a US subsidiary) agreed to pay USD 100 million to settle a class action lawsuit over alleged gender discrimination.Tencent is on par with its industry peers in respect of data privacy management and has mitigated its risk by training its staff on cyber security and obtaining certifications for known information security frameworks, including ISO 27001.",,0.0,10.0,5.0,,0.0,3.0,,2.0,,10.0,Other,Oiland Gas Refiningand Marketing Associates

A recent industry reassessment (as of June 2022) indicated a lower ESG performance score for Shenzhen Investment, relative to ESG industry peers, contributing to the downgrade. Also, while the company's green building practices are in line with those of peers, we note an increasing trend in its GHG intensity from 11 tCO2/USD million sales in FY 2018 to 23.5 in FY 2019 and 27.5 in FY 2020. We found limited disclosures on the proportion of total property portfolio with green certifications.Our model indicates property developers have high exposure to corruption risks due to factors such as reliance on construction permits. Further, the company's status as a Chinese state-owned entity may increase such exposure. Shenzhen Investment lags most global peers in adopting group-wide business ethics training and executive- or board-level oversight of ethics controls. We also note weaknesses, such as the lack of a majority independent board, in its corporate governance framework relative to peers.With property development constituting 56% of FY 2021 operations, Shenzhen Investment is exposed to risks of work-related injuries and fatalities. Like leading peers, the company has linked worksite safety performance to executive compensation and some of its subsidiaries are certified to ISO 45001 standards.Relative to peers, the company has strong initiatives such as inspection of construction material and quality of workm",,,,,,,,,,,,Real Estate,Investment Conglomerates Enterprises
